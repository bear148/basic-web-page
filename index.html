        <h1><strong>Gaming</strong></h1>

        <h4>Why is Diablo 4 my favorite game?</h4>
        <p>Diablo 4 is my favorite game because of the fact it is a loot based game. I <em>love</em> games where to progress, you have to go through dungeons, quests, and other things to find better gear which you can use to level up. Diablo 4 has a <em>ton</em> of different pieces of gears and abilities that allow you to build a wide variety of characters, all with their own set of abilities and specs, or specializations. Diablo 4 follows my idea of the perfect game.</p>
